Hobbies and Interests:
	- Playing soccer with my children
	- Video Games
	- Computer Science
	- Restoring old muscle cars


Programming Background:
	I only have the programming background that I have attained
	since joining this post-bacc program. Some of the material is 
	very hard to keep up with.

	My favorite project was the Final Project for CS161 because it
	gave me a huge sense of accomplishment.

	Time constraints have been the biggest obstacle
	to overcome. Balancing a full career and two
	small children is sometimes overwhelming.
